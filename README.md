## Assignment 1-2
Assignment 1 and 2 deal with the 1D Ising model (a.k.a. a spin chain). In the first assignment you will study the energy and specific heat of a spin chain, without an applied magnetic field. In the second assignment you will include the effects of the magnetic field and compute the magnetization and susceptibility of the spin chain. 
## Assignment 3
The last assignments deal with a 2D Ising model. You will study the thermodynami properties of a square lattice of spins as a function of temperature, to see evidence of the phase transition.
